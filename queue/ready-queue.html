    <p>Queues undeliverable messages to file for later delivery.</p>

    <p>If an outbound Node-Red node, such as an MQTT node goes offline, subsequent messages are
		lost until the node reconnects.  By wiring a <i>Queue</i> node ahead of the outbound
		node, and wiring status messages into <i>Queue</i>, undeliverable messages will instead be queued
		to a local file.</p>

    <p>When the outbound node reconnects, <i>Queue</i> will forward on messages from the
		queue in the same order they were received, until the queue becomes empty
		or the outbound node again goes offline.  While <i>Queue</i> drains the queue of messages, any new
		messages that arrive are appended to the queue to ensure ordered delivery is maintained.</p>

		<p>Once the queue becomes empty, and the outbound node is still connected, <i>Queue</i> will again
		forward on messages and bypass the queue storage entirely.</p>

		<p>The <i>Connected Status Matches</i> section is a regular expression <i>^connected</i> which
		matches all status text messages that start with <i>connected</i>.  In addition to regular
		expressions, you can also specify a simple substring match.  Because there is no
		value specified to match <i>Disconnected Status Matches</i>, any message that doesn't
		match <i>^connected</i> will be deemed a disconnected state.</p>

		<p>Conversely, if a <i>Disconnected Status Matches</i> value is provided, but not for
		<i>Connected Status Matches</i>, then any status text that does not match will be
		deemed a connected state.</p>

		<p>Finally, if both a <i>Connected Status Matches</i> and <i>Disconnected Status Matches</i>
		value is given, then any status text doesn't match either, will be ignored, and
		the current state will remain.</p>

		<p>You must also specify a filename for the sqlite database that stores queued
		messages during a <i>disconnected</i> state.  This database file <strong>must not</strong> be
		shared between multiple queue nodes.</p>

		<p>Optionally, you can setup a max DB file size in (MB). The DB file will then be monitored not to go beyond
		this value. When this value is reached, the new messages will be forwarded to the next node, preventing the disk
		from being filled up. If the node is started with a DB file size already greater than the limit, the
		flow is stopped.
