    <p>Queues undeliverable messages to file for later delivery.</p>

    <p>If an outbound Node-Red node, such as an MQTT node goes offline, subsequent messages are
		lost until the node reconnects.  By wiring a <i>Queue</i> node ahead of the outbound
		node, and wiring status messages into <i>Queue</i>, undeliverable messages will instead be queued
		to a local file.</p>

    <p>When the outbound node reconnects, <i>Queue</i> will forward on messages from the
		queue in the same order they were received, until the queue becomes empty
		or the outbound node again goes offline.  While <i>Queue</i> drains the queue of messages, any new
		messages that arrive are appended to the queue to ensure ordered delivery is maintained.</p>

		<p>Once the queue becomes empty, and the outbound node is still connected, <i>Queue</i> will again
		forward on messages and bypass the queue storage entirely.</p>

		<p>The <i>Connected Status Matches</i> section is a regular expression <i>^connected</i> which
		matches all status text messages that start with <i>connected</i>.  In addition to regular
		expressions, you can also specify a simple substring match.  Because there is no
		value specified to match <i>Disconnected Status Matches</i>, any message that doesn't
		match <i>^connected</i> will be deemed a disconnected state.</p>

		<p>Conversely, if a <i>Disconnected Status Matches</i> value is provided, but not for
		<i>Connected Status Matches</i>, then any status text that does not match will be
		deemed a connected state.</p>

		<p>Finally, if both a <i>Connected Status Matches</i> and <i>Disconnected Status Matches</i>
		value is given, then any status text doesn't match either, will be ignored, and
		the current state will remain.</p>

		<p>You must also specify a filename for the sqlite database that stores queued
		messages during a <i>disconnected</i> state.  This database file <strong>must not</strong> be
		shared between multiple queue nodes.</p>
